"""★ THIS IS THE ONLY FILE YOU NEED TO EDIT. ★

`predict(event)` is called once per competition event, after the webhook has
already been verified for you. Return one prediction per focal asset. Everything
else in this repo (webhook verification, dedupe, submission) is plumbing.

The default implementation asks an OpenAI model for a calibrated percentile. If
`OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set, it returns a 0.5 baseline so the full deploy →
receive → submit round-trip still works without burning credits. Replace the body
of `predict` with whatever strategy you like — the only contract is the return
shape documented below.

- Long-run base rates: about 25% of events land "up" (>0.75), 50% "neutral"
